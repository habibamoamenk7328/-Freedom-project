# -Freedom-project
For this freedom project I am planning to talk about how and why we dream. I decided to write about this because not many of us think about why dream.we just fall asleep and wake up and then repeat the same process every night. I also never thought about this but when researching topics for the freedom project  I realized that this topic really interested me. I started to think about many questions such as why when we wake up we donâ€™t remember anything of what we were dreaming about except the last few seconds of it. I will have to do more research to find that out.
